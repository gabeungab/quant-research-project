# CLAUDE.md — Project Context

## What this project is
Studying the regime-conditioned price impact of Trade Flow
Imbalance (TFI) in ES futures. The regime detector is the primary
contribution — a two-component multiplicative composite
(Kyle's lambda × trade arrival rate) that identifies periods of
elevated information asymmetry in real time from trades-only data.
TFI serves two explicitly separated roles: (1) a contemporaneous
characterization of adverse selection amplification, framed as a
confounded specification sensitivity result (not an empirical
finding), and (2) a forward return predictability test, which
produced a null result (β₃ = 0.000371, p = 0.234) — the primary
empirical finding, interpreted as an efficiency result about
information incorporation speed in ES futures.

Key design constraint: with trades-only data, a fully orthogonal
regime detector is impossible — any detector derived from aggressor-
side volume shares informational content with TFI. Lambda + TAR
multiplicative is the least circular available detector given this
constraint. Two layers of circularity are documented: (1) detector
construction level — lambda derived from the same signed flow inputs
as TFI; (2) regression interaction level — high TFI bars
mechanically have elevated RegimeScore, confirmed by monotonic
quintile pattern. Both are stated explicitly in the paper.

## Final results summary

Primary regression (T+1): β₃ = 0.000371, p = 0.234 — null.
Primary efficiency finding. β₃ upward-biased by mechanical
co-elevation (quintile monotonicity), making null a conservative
bound.

Contemporaneous (lagged regime spec): β₃ = 0.000617, p = 0.078
— not significant. RegimeScore lag-1 autocorrelation = 0.8064.
Residual confounding dominant. Market maker calibration not
empirically supported.

Horizon analysis: null at T+5 (p = 0.798) and T+15 (p = 0.833).

Subsample stability: null in May–Sep (p = 0.495) and Oct–Dec
(p = 0.207). Structural null.

OOS validation (2026 Jan–Mar, N = 14,774): β₃ = 0.000371,
p = 0.006. Episodic — driven by final two weeks (Feb 23–Mar 6).
January (p = 0.671) and February (p = 0.162) individually null.
Late-period β₃ = 0.000774, p = 0.022. No orthogonal conditioning
variable explains it. In-sample finding stands.

Lagged regime conditioning: β₃ = −0.000152, p = 0.634 — null.
Cleanest possible test.

Midday subsample: β₃ = 0.000812, p = 0.147 — not significant,
2.2x full-sample. Pre-specified from theory.

Stable regime conditions: β₃ = 0.001016, p = 0.033 —
statistically significant. Strongest positive finding. Post-hoc
threshold (211 contracts lambda window std, bottom tercile).
Does not replicate OOS. Motivates LOB-based future research.

TFI quintile interaction: no quintile survives Bonferroni (α=0.01).
T+1 null not a linearity artifact. Monotonic Q1→Q5 confirms second
circularity layer.

Regime transition dynamics: β₄ = 0.000430, p = 0.061 — null.
Delta magnitude ratio 13.4x (large/small). No threshold significant.
Circularity confirmed as explanation.

## Markdown file purposes and language standards

JOURNAL.md — chronological session log. Contains: session
summary, findings specific to this project and dataset,
open questions, AI usage, next steps. Language is informal
and personal. Findings section captures project-specific
empirical observations and debugging discoveries — not
general concepts.

NOTES.md — general technical concept reference. Contains
concepts learned during the project that apply universally
— statistics, Python syntax, market microstructure mechanics.
Language explains concepts from first principles. This is
where general knowledge lives, not project-specific results.

PAPER.md — formal working paper source. Final version produced
as es-futures-microstructure.pdf.

phase4_findings.md — complete internal record of all Phase 4
test results, interpretations, diagnostic outputs, and design
decisions. More detailed than PAPER.md. Source of truth for
paper writing.

## Research design summary

**Signal:** TFI_t = (BuyVol_t − SellVol_t) / (BuyVol_t + SellVol_t)
Computed at 1-minute resolution from aggressor side field.

**Regime score (multiplicative):**
RegimeScore_t = logistic(z_lambda_t) × logistic(z_arrival_t)
Two components: Kyle's lambda (30-bar rolling OLS) and trade
arrival rate (5-bar rolling). Roll spread removed — non-orthogonal
to lambda, fails in one-sided markets, redundant with TAR.
All z-scores rolling, past data only. Set to 0 in exclusion windows.
High-regime (RegimeScore > 0.5): 12.1% of in-sample bars.

**Exclusion windows:**
- Final 10 min of session (MOC uninformed flow)
- +30 min POST-announcement only (FOMC, CPI, NFP) — pre-
  announcement window retained as potentially informed
- Contract roll dates + 3 preceding trading days

**Contemporaneous characterization:**
Return_t = α + β₁·TFI_t + β₂·RegimeScore_{t-1} +
           β₃·(TFI_t × RegimeScore_{t-1}) +
           β₅·TFI_{t-1} + ε_t
Uses lagged RegimeScore_{t-1}. TFI-Return confounding within the
bar remains irreducible. Specification sensitivity result only.
β₃ = 0.000617, p = 0.078 (not significant).

**Primary regression:**
Return_{t+1} = α + β₁·TFI_t + β₂·RegimeScore_t +
               β₃·(TFI_t × RegimeScore_t) +
               β₄·Return_t + β₅·TFI_{t-1} + ε_t
β₃ is the primary test statistic.
Final result: β₃ = 0.000371, p = 0.234 — null efficiency finding.

## Standards for Claude Code to enforce
- Train/test split is time-based: in-sample 2025, out-of-sample
  2026. Never touch out-of-sample data for specification search.
- Methodology must be pre-registered before formal tests. Flag
  if tests run before plan is documented in JOURNAL.md.
- All regressions require Newey-West standard errors (maxlags=5).
  Flag if default OLS standard errors are used.
- Flag if multiple hypothesis tests run without Bonferroni
  correction.
- Transaction cost analysis required before any result claim.
  ES futures tick size = 0.25 index points (~4 basis points).
- RegimeScore must be set to 0 in all exclusion windows before
  any regression — flag if exclusions are not applied.
- All rolling estimates must use only past data. Flag any
  lookahead bias in rolling window construction.
- All results must be reproducible from /src code on raw data.

## Rules for Claude Code in this project
- Point out methodological errors or oversights
- Do not generate analysis, write paper sections, or interpret
  results
- When I show you an error, explain what caused it before giving
  the fix
