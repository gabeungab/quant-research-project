signal_construction.py — Signal and regime score construction.

Provides four functions used throughout the analysis pipeline:

    compute_lambda          — Kyle's lambda (rolling price impact estimate)
    compute_arrival_rate    — Trade arrival rate (rolling mean trade count)
    compute_regime_score    — Multiplicative informed trading regime score
    compute_exclusion_mask  — Boolean mask for contaminated bars

All functions operate on 1-minute bar resolution and assume RTH-only
input data (9:30 AM – 4:00 PM ET). Rolling estimates use only past
data — no lookahead bias is introduced.

def compute_lambda(df, window=30):
    """
    Estimate Kyle's lambda via rolling OLS of 1-minute bar price changes
    on aggregate signed order flow. Lambda measures price impact per unit
    of order flow and serves as the primary proxy for information asymmetry.

    Estimation uses the closed-form OLS coefficient:
        lambda = cov(delta_p, signed_flow) / var(signed_flow)

    computed over a rolling window of 1-minute bars. NaN is returned for
    bars where the rolling window is incomplete (first `window` bars of
    each session) or where signed flow variance is zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Clean RTH trades DataFrame with ts_event_et, price, size,
        and side columns.
    window : int
        Rolling window in 1-minute bars. Default 30.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Kyle's lambda estimate at each 1-minute bar, indexed by
        ts_event_et. Positive values indicate upward price impact

    Elevated arrival rates indicate heightened market activity and serve as a

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame

    """
    Combine Kyle's lambda and trade arrival rate into a continuous RegimeScore
    in [0, 1] using a multiplicative formulation:

        RegimeScore_t = logistic(z_lambda_t) × logistic(z_arrival_t)

    where logistic(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) and z_lambda, z_arrival are
    rolling z-scores of each component over their respective windows.

    The multiplicative structure enforces a hierarchical relationship:
    lambda provides the primary adverse selection signal, and TAR acts
    as a scaling factor. When lambda is low, RegimeScore is low regardless
    of TAR. When TAR is low, it suppresses the lambda signal proportionally,
    preventing misclassification of illiquid or thin-market episodes as
    informed trading regimes. RegimeScore is high only when both components
    are simultaneously elevated.

    Bars in the exclusion mask (post-announcement windows, MOC close period,
    contract roll windows) are set to 0.0 regardless of indicator values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lambda_series : pd.Series
        Kyle's lambda estimates at each 1-minute bar.
    arrival_series : pd.Series
        Trade arrival rate estimates at each 1-minute bar.
    exclusion_mask : pd.Series

    lambda_window : int

    three categories of contaminated observations:

        1. Final 10 minutes of each RTH session (15:50–16:00 ET):
           excluded due to MOC order flow domination — mechanical,
           publicly announced execution that elevates volume and lambda
           without genuine adverse selection.

        2. Post-announcement windows (+30 minutes after each FOMC,
           CPI, and NFP release): excluded because public information
           arrival drives directional flow that mechanically inflates
           lambda without reflecting private information. Pre-announcement
           windows are retained as potentially informed.

        3. Contract roll dates and 3 preceding trading days: excluded
           to remove structural illiquidity and mechanical volume
           migration accompanying front-month contract expiration.

    All exclusions are restricted to RTH bars only (9:30–16:00 ET).
